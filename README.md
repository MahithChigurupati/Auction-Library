# Auctions Library

**Introduction:**

As part of the INFO 7500 Coursework for this semester, you are tasked with designing and developing a comprehensive library of auctions. Whether you are already familiar with Web 3 or are just beginning to explore its concepts, this document will serve as your guide, providing all the instructions and resources you need to successfully complete a series of assignments.

## Assignment Overview

In this coursework, you will build decentralized applications (dApps) that encompass different types of auctions widely used in the industry. Specifically, you will delve into:

1. Sealed Bid Auctions
2. Sneaky Bid Auctions

The project consists of multiple milestones, each due weekly until the final class of the semester. These milestones are designed to progressively build upon the work accomplished in previous stages. Please note that you have a total of seven late days at your disposal, which can be utilized across all homework assignments during the semester.

Each milestone is due on the date specified in the table below. You should submit each completed milestone to Canvas as a link to your GitHub repository and a tagged commit with the corresponding version number.

| Version # | Milestone                           | Due Date | % Final Grade | Submission  |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- | -------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| v1.0      | Basic Vickrey Auction               | 9/5      | 14%           | GitHub repo |
| v2.0      | NFT Vickrey Auction                 | 9/12     | 14%           | GitHub repo |
| v3.0      | NFT Vickrey Auction with ERC20 Bids | 9/19     | 14%           | GitHub repo |
| v4.0      | Upgradeability                      | 9/26     | 14%           | GitHub repo |
| v5.0      | [Milestone 5 Name]                  | 10/      | 14%           | GitHub repo |
| v6.0      | [Milestone 6 Name]                  | 10/      | 14%           | GitHub repo |
| v7.0      | [Milestone 7 Name]                  | 10/      | 14%           | GitHub repo |

Grading will be based on:

- Writing sufficient test cases to achieve 100% line and 100% branch coverage on your Solidity code.
- Having thorough expectations in each test case.
